Introduction
============

This utility would be useful to make easier create packages
for different distributions.

The first version only create the files needed by debian

Would be possible integrate some of this changes in Sugar,
working in a feature based in http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Features/Activity.info

Testing instructions:
--------------------

* Clone calculate activity

git clone git@github.com:godiard/sugarlabs-calculate.git

* Add the following lines to activity.info file

```
homepage = http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activities/Calculate
long_description: Sugar Learning Platform - calculate activity
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.
 .
 Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
 packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
 instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
 Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
 be invited to join a collective Activity session.
 .
 Calculate is a simple but powerfull calculator for the Sugar environment.

sources_format = tar.bz2
```

In the activity directory add a file debian.info

```
[Package]
name = sugar-calculate-activity
version = 0godiard1
vcs-git = https://github.com/godiard/debian-sugar-calculate-activity.git
vcs-browser = https://github.com/godiard/debian-sugar-calculate-activity.git
primary_branch = 0.104

[Maintainer]
name = Debian Sugar Team
email = pkg-sugar-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org
uploaders = Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>,
 Gonzalo Odiard <godiard@gmail.com>
```

* Run the utility

```
python pack_act.py ./sugarlabs-calculate
```

When finish, a directory sugar-calculate-activity will be created and all the files needed to create the debian package are created.

* Create the package

```
cd sugar-calculate-activity
sudo pdebuild
```

Limitations
-----------

* Only gtk2 activities right now
* Need odify to work as James proposed with a branch instead of in a separated directry
* This testing version have fixed sugarlabs-calculate as the activity directoryand debian as the distribution
